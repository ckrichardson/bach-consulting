# Bach Consulting Website

This is a simple project that I used to explore the Flutter framework using the Dart language.   
It has simple routing, image loading, and simple interactive features that one may find on a basic consulting web page.
Currently the application is being rendered with the Flutter Canvas.

To run:
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
And choose web browser for debugging
